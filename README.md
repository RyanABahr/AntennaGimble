# Antenna Gimble

This project is intended create a basic gimble that can be utilized for anechoic chambers. 

This includes:
A simple firmware for arduinos to control stepper motors (with the recommended driver)
A corresponding driver for matlab or python. 
A 3D model for 1, 2 and 3 axis designs, including holes to run cables through. 

The recommended hardware at the time is:
Controller: Any arduino with 5V logic.
Motor: Any stepper motor really, pancake with 1.8 degrees currently in use.
Driver: Silent step sticks at the moment. 

Eventually, some processing code will arise for python.
